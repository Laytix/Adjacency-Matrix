# Adjacency-Matrix
A project showing my understanding of adjacency matrix.

The GAMEMAIN.cpp is what tests the program that is initialized in gamegraph.h and the algorithm is in gamegraph.cpp.

cmd.txt shows you the type of commands the program accepts.

The program will thell you where there is a romm but unfortunately i couldn't figure out the logic to prevent and alert the user when there is no room to go to in a certain direction.

The gamelayout.txt is the map of the game.

This program was given as an assingment in my university and have gotten permission to add it.
